Ayesha's Dashboard was created with one purpose: being a massive contributing factor to the business's future growth.
The dashboard was created to display a higher level view of operations, costs and employees. 

The first rawMaterial function and module allows the business to automate buying of stock, at a price they are comfortable 
with, and when the bank balance is above a certain amount. In this case, the cost of stock was to be no more than N$20, 
and the bank balance had to be above N410 000. A set number of unit order when both criterias a met was also set, in this
case, 2000. This process runs once a week, unless a predetermined sentinel is entered. This function was designed 
by all the group members.

The totalComission module allows the user to extract information on individual salespersons and the sales team as
a whole. The main benefit the business garners from this is an accurate tracking of commissions and sales. This
function was created by Joanne and Avihe.

The workerWage module was created to calculate an accurate compensation for the labour of workers manufacturing the
products. The case structure for the workerWage was created by Joseph, Robin and Willy.

Finally, we have the customerDiscount module. This was created to reward loyal customers, whilst ensuring the product(s)
sell at a profit. This was created by all group members.
