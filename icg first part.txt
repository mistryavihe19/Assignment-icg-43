

This is the first part of our whole  format desing for maiking the scrach app that will tackle all the
three required outcomes hihglithed for the asheya beauty salon . So we first tackled the first bullet 
by coming up with an idea that will maximize or monitor financial returns of products in stock that will 
innovate and creates better decision making financially for the salon. The idea will calculate all 
capital invloved in menaging all operations, expenses which includes disconts made,bonuses,also profit and this will help decide 
wether efficient is met financially and value is created.


so these is the begining part

what i propose the for or the final product should include 
The idea that i got is to track or range a customers in according to the overall products they buy or sallon visits within a specific range 
of time so we know overall participaton in buying products or sallon visits so we can create customer intimacy by 
providing sort of treats or special benefits to them if they qualify they recieve this benefits. not only does this attractt customer but create 
a loyal customer base. new or old customers will be like given a unique id which is activated and whenever they oder packages when getting it they write id
to add or singnify their prove for what they purchased    
to elborate more 
if a customer buys a packages >2 in for 4< weeks 
he or she will get a 15% discount for the next three purchase they make  
for salon visits same,= visits >2 in 5< weaks 
nexts two vists free

since products are deliverd record keeping will be taken
also at salon
