

This is the first part of our whole  format desing for maiking the scrach app that will tackle all the
three required outcomes hihglithed for the asheya beauty salon . So we first tackled the first bullet 
by coming up with an idea that will maximize or monitor financial returns of products in stock that will 
innovate and creates better decision making financially for the salon. The idea will calculate all 
capital invloved in menaging all operations, expenses which includes disconts made,bonuses,also profit and this will help decide 
wether efficient is met financially and value is created.


so these is the begining part
